 Q) What kind of directives we are having?

    Attribute directives                 : ngStyle , ngClass         // Here the matter is we are just applying the style.
                                                                    // that means that we are not removing the element
                                                                    // from the DOM
    
    Structural directives                : ngFor, ngIf, ngSwitch    // Based on the condition we are going to decide wheather we 
                                                                       are going to add the element or remove the element
                                                                    // in the Dom..
